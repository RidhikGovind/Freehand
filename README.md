### How to test "Freehand" app

- Open the live demo website seen above in "Two separete chrome windows" (Press Ctrl + N twice in chrome)
- Bring the two chrome windows side by side so that each windows content is visible
- Hit refresh( or F5) on both windows to make it responsive to the current screen size
- In the 1st chrome window, draw something on the canvas
- In the 2nd chrome window, you can see that the same content of 1st windows is being displayed (if the content is not being display at first Press "Load" Button)
- Now both screen's are synced at the same time. Have fun scribbling !
